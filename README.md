## What it is

This is an application to manage your expenses, it shows you all your payments in a scrollable list and shows you the expenses of the week in a chart with the percentage of money used each day of the week. 
The application adapts to different screen sizes and works well in portrait or landscape mode, with minor adjustments to improve on-screen display.
